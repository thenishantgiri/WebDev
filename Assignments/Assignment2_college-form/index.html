    <p align=center>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish
        Highlands. It accepted magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment. It was a
        state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic.
    </p>
    <p align=center>The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To
        Muggles, the
        school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in
        order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves
        from any harm.
    </p>
    <p align=center>Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical
        institutions in the
        Wizarding World, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang
        Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United
        States. Children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age
        eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born, a staff member from the school visited the child
        and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the Wizarding
        world.
    </p>
    <p align=center>The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs),
        which, translated
        from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".
